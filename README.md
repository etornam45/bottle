## The Bottle üçº Programming Language;

 The bottle programming is a project @etornam45 started in order to learn and understand 
 what programming languages are and how they work. 
 To execute code on the CPU ~(0101001110, 1101001110, 1101101110)
    Mainly to understand how language `parser` work to represent code in an `AST` 


### Structure of the project
 - Tokentype representation.
 - Tokenizer (Lexer).
 - Parser  (syntax analysis).
 - Evaluation ~~ (Not Implemented Yet)

### Contribution

 - This is a project I started in order to learn more about programming languages by building a programming language
 - You can freely make a PR or fork the repo. I'm ready to learn from everyone 
 - Please try it out if you can. 

 THANK YOU
